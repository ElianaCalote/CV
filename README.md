## Your Name

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

For the past 7 years I’ve been working in Child Care as a team leader, responsible for several children in a Nursery.
After careful thinking, I arrived to the conclusion that I needed a job that could give me something that Child Care does not: I needed a job that could challenge me, that I could look back and say: "I've done this!", a job where I could continuously learn and progress.
